                <h3>Tip 1: Make a Budget</h3>
                <p> One of the most important things to keep in mind is to evaluate your spendings and savings. Thus,
                    one of the first steps that you need to do is to compare your income and expenses. This can be done
                    using <span>EXPENSO</span>. Are you in the green (income greater than expenses)? Great! Make sure
                    you're saving money every month.

                    If you're in the red (expenses greater than income), you'll want to think about ways to reduce your
                    spending or increase what you're making each month.

                <h3>Tip 2: Track your Spending</h3>
                <p>Write down every purchase you make or use a budget app like <span>EXPENSO</span>.
                    Simply tracking what you spend can help you notice patterns, make you more aware of where your money
                    is going, and help you identify if you need to make a change.

                <h3>Tip 3: Look out for Free Money</h3>
                <p>Scholarships, grants, and bursaries are available everywhere. Don't waste your chance on securing
                    important financial aids. Many scholarships receive a small number of
                    applications, so it's worth putting in the time and effort to apply.

                <h3>Tip 4: SAVE MONEY ON TEXTBOOKS/SELL YOUR TEXTBOOKS</h3>
                <p>Buy used textbooks from former students on Craigslist, Kijiji, or Facebook groups.

                    Also check your campus store to see if they have a rental program available for some books. Also,
                    don't forget to check Amazon for some great deals.

                    Once your done with your textbooks, don't leave it sitting in the dust. Find a way to sell it by
                    finding students that need it.

                <h3>Tip 5: Food/Grocery</h3>
                <p>Your greatest monthly spend, aside from rent, is most certainly food. While eating out frequently is
                    the most convenient choice, it is also the most expensive. Adopting a do-it-yourself approach to
                    food consumption is an excellent method to save money while also improving your cooking abilities.
                    Moreover, you'll know exactly what items you'll need to buy if you plan out your meals for the week
                    ahead.
